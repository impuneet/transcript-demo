00:06:58.290 --> 00:08:17.730
Jason Strachan: Hello. Hello
Jeff. Are you hearing me?

2
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.310
Jeff Anderson: Hello. Hello.

3
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.880
Jason Strachan: All right, give
me one second, since you're on

4
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.960
video, I am not quite the video
appropriate right now.

5
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.980
Jeff Anderson: Okay.

6
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.410
Jason Strachan: I mean, throw on
a jacket, give me a minute.

7
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.620
Jeff Anderson: No problem. You
don't need to dress up for me.

8
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.630
Jason Strachan: Okay. How are
you doing good, how about you?

9
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.550
Jeff Anderson: You look younger
than your picture.

10
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.850
Jason Strachan: I guess that's a
good thing, I think it's a good

11
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.120
thing.

12
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.740
Jeff Anderson: At my age, that's
a good thing.

13
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.710
Jason Strachan: How's it going
today? How's your day going?

14
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.270
Jeff Anderson: It's going well
how about you

15
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.750
Jason Strachan: Going well, no,
no complaints at all. Thank you

16
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.570
so much for helping us debut
this transcription service that

17
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.350
we're using, you know, we think
it'll be pretty good for the

18
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.070
clients because you'll, you
know, instead of having to write

19
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.190
down whatever we talked about
you'll be able to just get the

20
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:31.110
recording, and basically use it
to, you know, talk to your

21
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.900
clients or using whatever
fashion you feel is best.

22
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.900
Jeff Anderson: Yeah, yeah,
absolutely. Glad to do it and

23
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.770
send it up the line I think it's
a great idea because it will

24
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.700
enable me instead of sitting
here scribbling notes down to

25
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.410
really, I think better engage
with you and listen to you in a

26
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.330
at a higher qualitative level.
So, I'm all for it.

27
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.730
Jason Strachan: Absolutely,
absolutely. Well, once again,

28
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.620
thank you. I'm so how is first
things first, how is Kelly doing

29
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.400
right now?

30
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.860
Jeff Anderson: Um, I think that
she is stable, she is stage

31
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.890
four, as I understand it, and I
talked to her mother, about a

32
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:21.930
week ago, and I believe there is
either she's doing radiation

33
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.380
targeted radiation or, or she's
contemplating doing it there was

34
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.400
some discussion I'm pretty sure
of radiation being a modality

35
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:37.110
that they're going to try. Her
mother is, you know, very very

36
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.550
despondent, you know, in her
tone and in her you know she's

37
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.530
got a daughter is what 21 or 22
years old, who's, who's trying

38
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.150
to just go to school, she's in
college, I believe, and yet you

39
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.060
know she's got this, this cloud
hanging over her head this very,

40
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.020
very big cloud.

41
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.560
Jason Strachan: Yeah,
absolutely. So, I'll just get

42
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.940
into my backgrounds in
orthopedics, I'm pretty familiar

43
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.100
with, Ewing sarcoma
osteosarcoma, one of the luckier

44
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.690
things in this case is that it's
Ewing's and Ewing sarcoma, is it

45
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.040
a lot of the times it does
present as stage four, but it's

46
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.960
a very slow growing tumor So
that's the thing, or the PET

47
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.070
scan showed that there's really
no spread to solid organs so

48
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.580
it's just the involvement of the
vertebra, it's extremely

49
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.710
responsive to chemotherapy and
radiation. It's actually tapping

50
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:44.920
towards 100%, in terms of the
five year survival rate. Oh, I

51
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.170
think she will do well. And just
to get to the evaluation by

52
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:57.370
people before. Yeah, it's you
know it's really tough to state

53
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:03.790
that it should have been found.
The reason is, it's not hard so

54
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.250
patients with scoliosis. You're
going to be doing X rays

55
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.710
primarily, especially if the
curve is not severe enough to

56
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.210
require surgery. So someone
with, especially if they're not

57
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.920
finished growing, which she
wasn't at the time, you'd

58
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.130
believe that you would be
monitoring the growth so you

59
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:32.230
would just do serial X rays and
monitor and center, physical

60
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.580
therapy because the thought is
you want to increase the

61
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.920
strength of your core and the
stabilizing back muscles that

62
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.060
course that you would take,
rather than doing an MRI or a CT

63
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.140
scan, there's really no
indication for it, right unless,

64
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.590
unless they have another
syndrome. Like patients with

65
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.630
Marfan Syndrome, or some
patients with neuroblastoma,

66
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:08.500
where the neurofibromatosis.
Those patients can have the

67
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.980
arrangements within the spinal
cord, that would mandate, you

68
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.780
doing an MRI for them so if they
have a cord less than 40

69
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.400
degrees, sorry a curb less than
40 degrees for them. You would

70
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.020
do an MRI, but not for you know
a young girl with no other

71
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.010
issues with it with a curve that
seems to be idiopathic

72
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:36.820
adolescent scoliosis. The follow
up for me was appropriate. I

73
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.810
don't see any issue with it. By
the time that she began having

74
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:48.250
severe pain, and they started
observing following her up there

75
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.360
so that would have been earlier
in 2020. Yeah, if they had done

76
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.800
an MRI and found it, there
really would be no difference in

77
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.240
the management. So I don't
really see a standard of care

78
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.900
breach here, I think most
orthopedic surgeons most spine

79
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.820
surgeons would say that this is
what we would have done as well,

80
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:15.340
and especially because the
lumbar Ewing sarcoma is so rare.

81
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.720
It's usually more in the sacral
region and that is where you'd

82
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.120
end up having a poor prognosis.
So, I think they actually

83
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.560
managed her as well as they
should have. And luckily

84
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.100
throughout all of this I think
her prognosis is still good.

85
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.720
Despite unfortunately having to
go through chemo and radiation.

86
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.040
The fact is that, even if it's
had been found early, they would

87
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.590
have still had to put her
through chemo and radiation.

88
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.090
Jeff Anderson: I see. And for
that is because it's, it's so

89
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.800
slow growing, they would have
the change in terms of the

90
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.610
progression of the disease, or
the cancer wouldn't have been so

91
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.370
great that they would have been
more invasive or done a

92
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.810
different modality of treatment?

93
00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:05.309
Jason Strachan: Yeah,
absolutely. Okay, in sarcoma,

94
00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:11.639
the, the choice of management
has been chemotherapy, the

95
00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:18.299
chemotherapy regimes that are
instituted are pretty successful

96
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:22.889
and work very well, they have
found recently so there's really

97
00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:25.619
no change, they would have
always given her chemo.

98
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.670
Jeff Anderson: And I'm curious
how you came to know what seems

99
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.510
to me to be a significant amount
of, of, have a significant

100
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.300
amount of knowledge about this
particular cancer and do some

101
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.050
research and you have to happen
to have dabbled in this, so to

102
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.440
speak?

103
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.270
Jason Strachan: Okay, well, so I
grew up, practice medicine in

104
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:52.120
Jamaica, and we, in orthopedics
in Jamaica we do or own

105
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.660
orthopedics oncology. So we
manage osteosarcomas which

106
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.100
usually have a very poor
prognosis. We manage our Ewing

107
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.320
sarcomas, which usually have a
pretty good prognosis and

108
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:13.990
unfortunately we don't have as
readily accessible tests to be

109
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:19.240
able to evaluate so we use a lot
of clinical findings we use X

110
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.800
rays. If we can get an MRI or CT
scan we will eventually get to

111
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.580
it. But we have to manage those
so we become very comfortable

112
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.760
with the diagnosis because it's
ours to manage.

113
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.460
Jeff Anderson: Got it. But
again, prior to spring of last

114
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:44.610
year, spring of 2020, you just
don't see anything that should

115
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.950
have red flagged. To Dr.
Mantega, I believe his name is

116
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.230
at Bone and Joint Center. Hey,
there's something maybe going on

117
00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:04.440
here beyond musculo-ligamentous
scolio-based or etiology, back

118
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:04.680
pain.

119
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.010
Jason Strachan: Yeah, I don't
think it would be, I mean, there

120
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:14.110
are some surgeons, probably
would have gone on a leg, very

121
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.430
early said hey you know what,
let me do a CT scan of this just

122
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:24.250
to check. But the vast majority
wouldn't. She's a growing girl,

123
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.960
she has scoliosis, it's very
common to have back pain

124
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.160
associated with scoliosis so it
is. And the back pain itself can

125
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.980
be very difficult to control, so
it's not too surprising that she

126
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:44.080
didn't really respond. But, but
according to physio she was

127
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.990
seeming to be paying fee, a lot
of the times, it's, it would be

128
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.220
a bit difficult point on it and
say hey you know, they should

129
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.750
have done this earlier and I
find it very tough to think

130
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.530
someone else, or, or the
consensus would be that they

131
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.130
should have ordered something
else, fairly in someone at that

132
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.560
age, and not with something
that's as distracting as clear.

133
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:20.750
Jeff Anderson: So scoliosis was
a very very good explanation for

134
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.580
her back pain, and this was not
a situation where there was some

135
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.110
symptoms some clinical
indication, some imaging that

136
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.590
should have been done, because
there was even an orange flag

137
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.550
popping up to Dr Mantega in a
differential forming in his

138
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:43.100
mind, hey, this doesn't look
like scoliosis based back pain,

139
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.220
this looks like something
different I quite don't quite

140
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.920
know what it is and therefore
the differential begins to form

141
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.130
in his head, and weigh maybe
down at the end of differential

142
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.360
is you and sarcoma, or something
like that, that that's just not

143
00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.260
you does not seem that is that
is the picture that that should

144
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.520
have emerged here for him?

145
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.520
Jason Strachan: Yeah, it's the
scoliosis is a very, very

146
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:13.390
convenient, as is, I can promise
you that much like it's, that's,

147
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.050
that's very good. So, that's the
only, that's one of the few

148
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.970
things that could actually
excuse the fact that this was

149
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.620
not found on time because if
there was no other issue then

150
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.450
questions come, Hey, why wasn't
this done earlier and on the

151
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:37.060
fact that when she was having
numbness in the limbs, that's

152
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.930
when they referred her or
decided to do the MRI. That's

153
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.380
usually what happens because you
start to have spinal cord

154
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.130
involvement or nerve
involvement, and you decide that

155
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.540
this is when the, it should be
done, and they didn't wait, it

156
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.720
seemed pretty immediate, which
is how it should go.

157
00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.220
Jeff Anderson: Yep. Yeah, and
the and the proper imaging to

158
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.640
take a look at what was going
on, once they knew something was

159
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.980
there, it looks like they
performed an MRI without

160
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.140
contrast. That's when they see
this four centimeter tumor, and

161
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.980
then they're scheduling her for
another with contrast, when she

162
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.950
ends up at the ER. So, okay.

163
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.860
Jason Strachan: That's the thing
about bodies because though

164
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.170
without contrast is to see if
there is anything impinging on

165
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.980
the nerve roots. So, when you
see that there is something at

166
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.940
the nerve root, at that point,
you would go for one with

167
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.360
contrast because with contrast
would pick up soft tissue,

168
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.190
tumors as well. And once you
pick up a soft tissue tumor,

169
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.200
after that, you'd opt for the
PET scan just to see if there's

170
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.570
any involvement elsewhere.

171
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.740
Jeff Anderson: Yeah, yeah. And
so a CT isn't really part of the

172
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.010
imaging hierarchy for this
problem?

173
00:20:58.889 --> 00:21:02.249
Jason Strachan: Really, what the
CT scan, generally shows you is

174
00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:07.199
really just bony invasion, it
gives you good bone details so

175
00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:11.789
after the MRI, they were able to
see that there was something

176
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:15.509
involving the bone. You really
don't need a CT scan and once

177
00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:19.349
you've already seen that on the
MRI. The MRI gives you more

178
00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:20.009
detail.

179
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.000
Jeff Anderson: Okay, and no more
contrast in particular for soft

180
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.730
tissue differentiation. Okay.
Okay. I think you've answered

181
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:34.580
all the questions, and I, I
appreciate your giving me some

182
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:40.790
information that may provide me
with some hopeful feedback to to

183
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.980
mom. And do you. I know you're
in Manhattan.

184
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.530
Jason Strachan: Well, I live in,
I live in Westchester

185
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.640
Jeff Anderson: in Westchester,
so I would assume mom sounds

186
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.300
like a very well educated,
bright woman, I would assume

187
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.930
that mom or mom and dad, I'm not
sure if dad's around, but but

188
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:05.000
mom certainly is managing her
care, it sounds like, where,

189
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.400
from your base of knowledge,
doctor, would you suggest this

190
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.180
young lady would be well advised
to seek treatment? Would you, I

191
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.540
mean,

192
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.070
Jason Strachan: I, I've been,
I've only been in New York for a

193
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:29.960
few years. My ex wife was at was
admitted to Mount Sinai in the

194
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.640
Upper East Side for a month.
And, you know, we had a very

195
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.370
good experience there for as
good an experience as you can

196
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.380
have, at a hospital so I am
somewhat partial to there. I do

197
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:47.270
like it there. So, if, if she's
in Manhattan to get her daughter

198
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.440
there then I think that'd be
pretty good. I'm not really sure

199
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.430
if there's like a Sloan
Kettering, in New York, or what

200
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.510
if there is any you know that's
the, you know famous oncology

201
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.620
institute, pretty much anywhere,
anywhere that you can get

202
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.670
treatment started evaluated. I
see that she started already,

203
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.140
but wherever she's comfortable
is the most important thing.

204
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.570
Oncology, it's always meant to
be about the peace of mind. You

205
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:22.070
know, it's very, very taxing on
the entire family unit. It's

206
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.730
really just about getting the
adequate support, say, where she

207
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.800
is, she feels comfortable, and
especially she's well educated,

208
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.270
she should be fine.

209
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.260
Jeff Anderson: Yeah, okay. Okay,
great. Thank you very much that

210
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.260
this was a great review and I
really appreciate I remember you

211
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.620
from another case I think you I
think you reviewed a case

212
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:50.030
involving a situation that was a
Syracuse case. A woman had a

213
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:55.490
manipulation under anesthesia.
And there was I think a fib

214
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.880
fracture or a hip fracture, I
don't know femur fracture, maybe

215
00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.750
it's femur because I think it-

216
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.600
Jason Strachan: I remember it
was a femur fracture, yeah.

217
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.130
Jeff Anderson: Yeah, so we ended
up not taking that case, I don't

218
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.010
know whether the woman retained
someone else but we turned it

219
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.370
down but I really appreciate
your review in that case so

220
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.100
Jason Strachan: No problem, Jeff
It was my pleasure. And thank

221
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.820
you very much for, you know,
allowing us to record this and

222
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.620
get this transcript service up
and running.

223
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.390
Jeff Anderson: Great, thanks
again doctor.

224
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.580
Jason Strachan: No prob, enjoy
the rest of your week, stay

225
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:25.970
safe.

226
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.850
Jeff Anderson: Stay well, stay
safe. Thank you. Alright, bye

227
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.120
bye.
